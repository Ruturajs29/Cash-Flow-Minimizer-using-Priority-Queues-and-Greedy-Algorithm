# **Cash Flow Minimizer**

Initially developed as a core **C++ project**, this application was later transformed into a **Django-based web application** to provide a user-friendly interface. It optimizes group financial transactions using a **greedy algorithm** with **priority queues**, minimizing the number of payments required to settle debts while ensuring fairness. The system uses **Cytoscape.js** for interactive transaction visualizations.

## üöÄ Features
- **Graph-Based Optimization**: Models debts as a directed graph.
- **Greedy Algorithm & Priority Queues**: Efficiently reduces transactions.
- **Django Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use UI.
- **Cytoscape.js Visualization**: Displays original and minimized transactions.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Graphs, Greedy Algorithm, Priority Queues
- **Backend**: Django, SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Cytoscape.js)

## üèó Setup & Installation  
### **Prerequisite:** Ensure Django is installed on your machine.
