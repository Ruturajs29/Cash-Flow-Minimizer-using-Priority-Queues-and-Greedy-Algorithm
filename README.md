# **Cash Flow Minimizer**

Initially developed as a core **C++ project**, this application was later transformed into a **Django-based web application** to provide a user-friendly interface. It optimizes group financial transactions using a **greedy algorithm** with **priority queues**, minimizing the number of payments required to settle debts while ensuring fairness. The system uses **Cytoscape.js** for interactive transaction visualizations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Graph-Based Optimization**: Models debts as a directed graph.
- **Greedy Algorithm & Priority Queues**: Efficiently reduces transactions.
- **Django Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use UI.
- **Cytoscape.js Visualization**: Displays original and minimized transactions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Graphs, Greedy Algorithm, Priority Queues
- **Backend**: Django, SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Cytoscape.js)

## 🏗 Setup & Installation  
### **Prerequisite:** Ensure Django is installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ruturajs29/Cash-Flow-Minimizer-using-Priority-Queues-and-Greedy-Algorithm.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   ```bash
   cd Cash-Flow-Minimizer-using-Priority-Queues-and-Greedy-Algorithm
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
